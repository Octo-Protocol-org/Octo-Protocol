# Database Migrations Decision Index & Audit Trail

`crates/store/migrations/` is strictly append-only and forward-only. Migrations must never be edited or reordered once merged.

This document serves as the single changelog-style decision index tracking every migration's structural changes, constraint choices, foreign key `ON DELETE` rules, and the reasoning behind non-obvious design decisions.

## Foreign Key `ON DELETE` Audit & Invariants

| Parent Table | Child Table | Foreign Key Column | `ON DELETE` Action | Security & Integrity Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `wallets` | `addresses` | `wallet_id` | `CASCADE` | Ephemeral customer addresses derived from base wallet; safe to cascade on dev cleanup. |
| `wallets` | `transactions` | `wallet_id` | `RESTRICT` | Financial ledger integrity: a wallet with confirmed on-chain activity must never be hard-deleted. |
| `addresses` | `transactions` | `address_id` | `RESTRICT` | Ensures attribution history remains immutable. |
| `wallets` | `withdrawals` | `wallet_id` | `RESTRICT` | Outbound payment records and client idempotency keys must be preserved. |
| `wallets` | `webhook_endpoints` | `wallet_id` | `CASCADE` | Outbound endpoints belong strictly to their parent wallet. |
| `webhook_endpoints` | `webhook_deliveries` | `endpoint_id` | `CASCADE` (historical) | **Audit Note (Issue #338)**: Hard deletion of an endpoint cascaded and erased delivery history. Migration 0021 introduced `deleted_at` soft-deletion so endpoints can be retired while keeping historical deliveries intact and queryable. |
| `wallets` | `ingest_cursor` | `wallet_id` | `CASCADE` | Horizon sync cursor has a 1:1 lifecycle with the wallet. |
| `users` | `wallets` | `user_id` | `SET NULL` | Preserves non-custodial wallets if an admin or dashboard user account is deleted. |
| `wallets` | `api_keys` | `wallet_id` | `CASCADE` | API keys derive their permissions solely from the parent wallet. |
| `users` | `audit_logs` | `user_id` | `CASCADE` | User-scoped audit events; system-level logs are archived independently. |
| `wallets` | `gas_sponsorship_configs` | `wallet_id` | `CASCADE` | Sponsorship configuration is a 1:1 extension of the sponsoring wallet. |
| `wallets` | `sponsored_transactions` | `wallet_id` | `RESTRICT` | Fee-bump ledger must be preserved for audit and daily budget calculations. |
| `wallets` | `withdrawal_allowlist_configs` | `wallet_id` | `CASCADE` | Anti-fraud toggle tied directly to wallet lifecycle. |
| `wallets` | `whitelisted_addresses` | `wallet_id` | `CASCADE` | Destination address list tied to the parent wallet's allowlist configuration. |
| `wallets` | `payment_links` | `wallet_id` | `CASCADE` | Public checkout links belong to the merchant wallet. |
| `addresses` | `payment_links` | `address_id` | `CASCADE` | Initial shared fallback address for checkout link. |
| `payment_links` | `payment_link_payments` | `link_id` | `CASCADE` | Intents are bound to checkout link lifecycle. |
| `addresses` | `payment_link_payments` | `address_id` | `SET NULL` | Per-intent address mapping (Issue #338/0015): nullified rather than cascading payment records if address record is pruned. |
| `transactions` | `payment_link_payments` | `transaction_id` | `RESTRICT` | Payment settlement records cannot orphan confirmed transactions. |
| `users` | `email_otps` | `user_id` | `CASCADE` | Short-lived authentication codes expire or purge with user deletion. |

## Migration Decision Index

| Version | File | Target Tables / Objects | Key Decisions, Constraints & `ON DELETE` Rules | Rationale / Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `0001` | `0001_init.sql` | `wallets`, `addresses`, `transactions`, `withdrawals`, `webhook_endpoints`, `webhook_deliveries`, `ingest_cursor` | `pgcrypto` extension; BIGINT stroops; `RESTRICT` on financial records (`transactions`, `withdrawals`); `CASCADE` on `webhook_deliveries`; partial unique on `(stellar_tx_hash, operation_index)`. | Baseline schema establishing financial integrity invariants, immutable ledger records, and AES-256-GCM ciphertext storage. |
| `0002` | `0002_horizon_op_id.sql` | `transactions`, `addresses` | Added `transactions.horizon_op_id` with partial unique index `uq_tx_horizon_op_id`; dropped redundant `uq_addresses_muxed`. | Robust idempotent deposit dedup using Horizon TOIDs (ledger+tx+op) regardless of operation index availability. |
| `0003` | `0003_users.sql` | `users` | Argon2id password hash, case-insensitive unique lowercase email constraint. | Core dashboard user authentication without reversible password storage. |
| `0004` | `0004_wallet_owner.sql` | `wallets` | Added `user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL`, `description TEXT`, index `idx_wallets_user`. | Links wallets to dashboard owners while preserving wallets if a user account is deleted. |
| `0005` | `0005_api_keys.sql` | `api_keys` | SHA-256 hash storage (`key_hash`), non-secret prefix, unique index on `wallet_id` for active keys, `ON DELETE CASCADE`. | Developer API keys stored securely as one-way hashes; replaces key upon regeneration. |
| `0006` | `0006_audit_logs.sql` | `audit_logs` | Append-only table referencing `users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`, tracking action, category, target, and IP. | Persistent audit trail for compliance and user visibility across dashboard operations. |
| `0007` | `0007_gas_sponsorship.sql` | `gas_sponsorship_configs`, `sponsored_transactions` | Config `ON DELETE CASCADE`; `sponsored_transactions` `ON DELETE RESTRICT`, `UNIQUE (inner_tx_hash)`. | Enables fee-bump sponsorship with daily budget tracking and prevents duplicate inner transaction sponsorships. |
| `0008` | `0008_scheme_version.sql` | `wallets` | Added `sealed_scheme SMALLINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1`. | Explicit cipher/KDF version tag enabling zero-downtime key rotation via `bin/migrate-keys`. |
| `0009` | `0009_token_denylist.sql` | `token_denylist` | SHA-256 hash of revoked JWTs with `expires_at` timestamp. | Stateless JWT revocation on logout without storing raw token strings in database. |
| `0010` | `0010_sponsored_tx_status_index.sql` | `sponsored_transactions` | Replaced `(wallet_id, created_at)` with composite `(wallet_id, status, created_at DESC)`. | Aligns indexing with actual query filters (`wallet_id` + `status`) in hot fee-budget checks. |
| `0011` | `0011_sponsored_and_audit_indexing.sql` | `sponsored_transactions`, `audit_logs` | Partial index for pending fee reservations; `pg_trgm` extension and GIN trigram index on audit logs. | Accelerates rolling daily budget CTEs and enables fast ILIKE search over audit actions/targets. |
| `0012` | `0012_client_custody.sql` | `wallets` | Added `custody TEXT CHECK (custody IN ('server', 'client'))`; made `sealed_*` nullable. | Accommodates non-custodial wallets where server never holds the user's private key or seed. |
| `0013` | `0013_withdrawal_allowlist.sql` | `withdrawal_allowlist_configs`, `whitelisted_addresses` | Config toggle default false; `whitelisted_addresses` unique `(wallet_id, address)` with `ON DELETE CASCADE`. | Anti-fraud defense-in-depth allowing wallets to restrict destination accounts prior to submission. |
| `0014` | `0014_payment_links.sql` | `payment_links`, `payment_link_payments` | Public slug unique; `payment_link_payments` unique `transaction_id`; CASCADE on link deletion. | Supports public merchant checkout URLs and tracks payment intent state transitions. |
| `0015` | `0015_payment_intent_address.sql` | `payment_link_payments` | Added `address_id UUID REFERENCES addresses(id) ON DELETE SET NULL`; unique pending index. | Binds distinct deposit address per payment intent to prevent cross-matching concurrent payments. |
| `0016` | `0016_ingest_last_polled.sql` | `ingest_cursor` | Added `last_polled_at TIMESTAMPTZ` and index on `(wallet_id, last_polled_at)`. | Decouples polling tick checks from activity updates so supervisor backoff functions correctly on dormant wallets. |
| `0017` | `0017_payment_link_redirect_url.sql` | `payment_links` | Added `redirect_url TEXT`. | Merchant post-payment browser redirection; developer-provided passthrough with no SSRF exposure. |
| `0018` | `0018_payment_status_expansion.sql` | `payment_link_payments` | Expanded status CHECK constraint to include `'expired'`, `'underpaid'`, `'overpaid'`. | Prevents miscrediting mismatched deposits while preserving auditability of unexpected amounts. |
| `0019` | `0019_email_otp.sql` | `email_otps` | Table referencing `users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`; code hash; purpose CHECK; optional `tx_hash_bound`. | Rate-limited email OTP verification for registration and high-risk withdrawal authorizations. |
| `0020` | `0020_username.sql` | `users` | Added `username TEXT` with unique partial index on `lower(username)`. | Case-insensitive unique display handles distinct from email addresses. |
| `0021` | `0021_soft_delete_webhook_endpoints.sql` | `webhook_endpoints` | Added `deleted_at TIMESTAMPTZ` and filtered indices on `(wallet_id)` where `deleted_at IS NULL`. | Soft-delete endpoint path (Issue #338) preventing accidental cascade-purges of `webhook_deliveries` logs. |
